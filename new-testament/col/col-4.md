1 _You who are a boss, do what is right to your servants. You know that you also have a Master in heaven._

2 _Always take time to talk to God. Put your mind on what you are saying. And thank God for what he has done._

3 _Talk to God about us too. Ask him to open a way for us to tell people his message. We want to tell Gods plan about Christ. That is why I am in prison because of that plan._

4 _I want to be free to talk about it as I should do._

5 _Act the right way to people who are not Christians. Make good use of your time._

6 _Always say good things when you talk. Talk in a way that will make people listen. Then you will know how to answer people._

7 _Tychicus will tell you all about me. He is a brother whom I love. He is a very good helper and works with me in the Lords work._

8 _I am sending him to you so that you will know about us and so that he may comfort your hearts._

9 _I am sending Onesimus with him. He is also a good brother whom I love. He is one of you. They will tell you all about everything here._

10 _Here are the people who send you greetings: Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, and Mark, a cousin of Barnabas. I have already told you to welcome him if he comes to you._

11 _Jesus, whose other name is Justus, also sends greetings. These men are the only Jews who are doing Gods work with me. And they have comforted me much._

12 _Epaphras sends you greetings. He is one of you and is a servant of Christ Jesus. He always talks to God about you with all his heart. He asks God to help you to be strong so that you will become grown-up Christians and know all that God wants you to do._

13 _I myself have seen how hard he has worked for you and for the people in the cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis._

14 _Luke, the doctor whom I love, and Demas also greet you._

15 _Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and also to Nympha and the church people who meet in her house._

16 _When you have read this letter, then be sure that it is also read to the church people in Laodicea. And be sure that you read the letter which will be sent to you from Laodicea._

17 _Tell Archippus, See that you do all the work which the Lord has given you to do._

18 _I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember that I am in prison. God bless you._

1 _Then Jesus crossed over the sea of Galilee. (Another name for this sea was Tiberias.)_

2 _Many people followed him because they saw the big works he had done in healing the sick people._

3 _Jesus went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples._

4 _The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near._

5 _When Jesus looked up, he saw many people coming to him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy food for these people to eat?_

6 _Jesus knew what he himself would do, but he said this to see what Philip would do._

7 _Philip answered him, It would take nearly a years wages to buy enough food for them,  even if each one gets only a little._

8 _One of Jesus disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, talked to Jesus._

9 _He said, A boy here has five loaves of bread and two small fish. But what can that little bit of food do for so many people?_

10 _Jesus said, Tell the people to sit down. Much grass was there. The number of men who sat down was about five thousand._

11 _Then Jesus took the bread and thanked God for it. He gave it to the disciples and they divided it among those who were sitting. He did the same thing with the fish. The people had all they wanted._

12 _When they had eaten enough, he said to his disciples, Gather up all the pieces that are left so that nothing will be lost._

13 _They gathered all the pieces of the five loaves. Twelve baskets full were left over after all the people had eaten enough._

14 _When those men saw the big work that Jesus did, they said, Truly, this is the Prophet that is to come into the world._

15 _The people wanted to take Jesus by force to make him a king. When he saw this, he left again and went on the hill by himself._

16 _In the evening his disciples went down to the lake called the sea of Galilee ._

17 _They got in a boat and crossed over the sea toward the town of Capernaum. It was dark,  but Jesus had not come back to them._

18 _A strong wind was blowing. It made the water very rough._

19 _They rowed the boat into the middle of the lake. Then they saw Jesus walking on the water. He came close to the boat. They were afraid._

20 _But Jesus said to them, It is I. Do not fear._

21 _Then they were glad to take him into the boat. Then at once the boat reached the land to which they were going._

22 _The people who stayed back on the land had seen one boat only. They had seen the disciples get in it and go away without Jesus._

23 _But there were some other boats from Tiberias. It was near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had thanked God for it._

24 _The next day the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there. Then they went to Capernaum in boats to look for Jesus._

25 _When they found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they said, Teacher, when did you get here?_

26 _Jesus said, I tell you the truth. You do not want me because you saw the big works I did,  but you want me because you ate all the bread you wanted._

27 _Do not work for the food that spoils, but work for the food that will never spoil, the food that will give you life for ever. The Son of Man will give you that food. God my Father has chosen him to do that._

28 _They asked him, What works does God ask us to do?_

29 _Jesus answered them, The work that God asks you to do is to believe in the one whom he has sent._

30 _They said, What big work will you do? We want to see it and believe you. What work are you are going to do?_

31 _Our fathers ate bread in the wilderness. The holy writings say, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. It was not Moses who gave you that bread from heaven. But my Father gives you true bread from heaven._

33 _He who comes down from heaven is the bread that God gives. He is the one who gives life to the world._

34 _They said to him, Lord, give us this bread always!_

35 _Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life. Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry.  Anyone who believes in me will never be thirsty._

36 _But I said to you that you have seen me, and yet you will not believe in me._

37 _All those whom my Father gives me, they will come to me. I will never turn anyone away who comes to me._

38 _I did not come down from heaven to do what I myself want to do. I came to do what the one who sent me wants me to do._

39 _My Father sent me. He wants me to lose nothing that he has given me. And he wants me to raise it up on the last day._

40 _My Father wants everyone who sees his Son and believes in him to live for ever. I will raise him up on the last day._

41 _The leaders of the Jews did not like Jesus to say, I am the bread that has come down from heaven._

42 _They said, Is he not Josephs son, Jesus? We know his father and mother. How can he say, "I have come down from heaven"?_

43 _Jesus answered them, There is no need for you to talk against me to each other._

44 _No one can come to me if my Father does not draw him. He sent me. I myself will raise up the one who comes to me. I will bring him back to life on the last day._

45 _The prophets wrote, "God will teach all people." So then, every person who listens to his words and learns what he says, he will come to me._

46 _But no person has seen my Father. The only one who has seen him is the one who comes from God. He has seen my Father._

47 _I tell you the truth. The person who believes in me will live for ever._

48 _I am the bread that gives life._

49 _Your fathers ate bread in the desert long ago, but they died._

50 _Here is bread that comes down from heaven. The person who eats this bread will never die._

51 _I am the bread that gives life. I came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live for ever. I will give bread so that the world may live. I am that bread._

52 _The leaders of the Jews began to quarrel with each other about what Jesus said. They said, How can he give us himself to eat?_

53 _Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If you do not eat the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you will not have life._

54 _Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood will live for ever. I will raise him up at the last day._

55 _I am real food, and my blood is real drink._

56 _Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood is in me and I in him._

57 _My Father is living. He sent me. I have my life from him. In the same way, the person who eats of me will live because of me._

58 _This bread which came down from heaven is not like the bread that your fathers ate.  They ate bread but they died. Anyone who eats this bread from heaven will live for ever._

59 _Jesus was in the meeting house in Capernaum when he was teaching people these things._

60 _Many of his disciples heard it. They said, This is a hard teaching. Who can listen to it?_

61 _But Jesus knew that his disciples did not like what he said. He asked, Is this hard for you?_

62 _What would you do if you saw the Son of Man go up to the place where he came from?_

63 _It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not help. The words I say to you are Spirit and life._

64 _But even so, some of you do not believe me. Jesus knew right from the beginning which ones of them would not believe. He knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him._

65 _Then Jesus said, That is why I said to you, "No one can come to me unless my Father lets him come." _

66 _After that, many of the followers of Jesus left him and stopped travelling around with him._

67 _Jesus said to the twelve disciples, Will you also leave me?_

68 _Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? It is you who has told us how we may live for ever._

69 _We believe now, and we know it is true. You are the Christ, the Son of the living God._

70 _Jesus said to them, Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil!_

71 _Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to give him over to people who hated him. Judas was one of these twelve disciples._

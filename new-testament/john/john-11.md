1 _A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha._

2 _Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick._

3 _So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, Lord, the one whom you love is sick._

4 _Jesus heard the message. He said, The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also._

5 _Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus._

6 _When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more._

7 _After that, he said to his disciples, Let us go back again to Judea._

8 _They said, Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?_

9 _Jesus answered them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world._

10 _But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see._

11 _After he said this, he said also, Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up._

12 _His disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again._

13 _But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest._

14 _Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, Lazarus is dead._

15 _For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him._

16 _Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, Let us all go and die with Jesus._

17 _When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days._

18 _Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem._

19 _Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died._

20 _As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house._

21 _Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died._

22 _But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for._

23 _Jesus said, Your brother will rise again._

24 _Martha said, I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day._

25 _Jesus said, I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died._

26 _Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?_

27 _She said, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world._

28 _When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you._

29 _When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him._

30 _Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him._

31 _The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out.  They went after her. They said, She is going to the grave to cry._

32 _Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died._

33 _Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much._

34 _Where have you buried him? he said. Come, Lord, and see, they said._

35 _Then Jesus cried._

36 _Look, the Jews said. He truly loved him very much!_

37 _Then some of them said, This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?_

38 _Jesus heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole._

39 _Jesus said, Take the stone away. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already._

40 _Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?_

41 _So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you because you have heard me._

42 _I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me._

43 _When he had said this, he shouted, Lazarus, come out!_

44 _Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, Take off the cloths and free him!_

45 _When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him._

46 _But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done._

47 _So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, What are we going to do?  This man is doing many big works._

48 _If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation._

49 _One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, You know nothing._

50 _You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down._

51 _He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year.  God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people._

52 _Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places._

53 _So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus._

54 _That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples._

55 _The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast._

56 _They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?_

57 _Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him._

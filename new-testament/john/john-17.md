1 _When Jesus had said these things, he looked up to heaven and said, Father, the time has come now. Make your Sons name great, so that your Son may make your name great._

2 _You have given your Son power over all people. So all those you have given him will live for ever._

3 _You are the only true God. If they know you, and Jesus Christ whom you sent, they will live for ever._

4 _I made your name great on earth. I have done the work you gave me to do._

5 _So now, Father, let my name be great with you. Make my name as great as it was when I was with you before the world was made._

6 _I have shown these men who you really are. They are men whom you gave me from the world. They belonged to you and you gave them to me. They have obeyed you._

7 _Now they really know that everything you gave me comes from you._

8 _I have told them the things that you told me to tell them. And they have believed my words. They know it is true that I was with you before I came. They have believed that you sent me._

9 _It is these men I am asking you for. I am not asking you for the people of the world. But I am asking for those you gave me, because they belong to you._

10 _All those I have are yours. And all you have are mine. And they make my name great._

11 _I am not in the world any longer. But they are in the world. And I am coming to you.  Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me. Then they will be one,  just as you and I are one._

12 _While I was with them, I took care of them in your name, which you gave me. I have taken care of them. Only one of them is lost. That is the one who was born to be lost.  What your book says came true._

13 _Now I am coming to you. I say these things while I am in the world so that they may be very glad, as I am._

14 _I have told them what you said. The world has hated them because they do not belong to the world. So also, I do not belong to the world._

15 _I do not ask you to take them out of the world. But I ask you to take care of them, so that the evil one of this world will not harm them._

16 _They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world._

17 _Make them clean by the true word and keep them for yourself. Your word is true._

18 _I have sent them into the world as you sent me into the world._

19 _I have made myself clean and kept myself for them, so that they may be clean and be kept for you also by the truth._

20 _I do not ask this for these people only; I ask it also for the people who will believe in me when they hear what these people say._

21 _I do this so that the people will all be one. That is the same way with us. You, my Father,  belong to me and I belong to you. I ask that they also may be joined to us. Then the world will believe that you have sent me._

22 _I have made them great the way you have made me great. That makes us one, as we are one._

23 _I belong to them and you belong to me, so that they all may be really one together. Then the world will know that you have sent me and that you have loved them just as you have loved me._

24 _Father, I want the people that you have given me to be with me. Then they will see that you made me great, because you loved me before you made the world._

25 _Father, you are the one who is right. The world has not known you. But I have known you. These people know that you have sent me._

26 _I have told them who you are. I will tell them again and again. Then they will love each other as much as you have loved me. And I will live in them._

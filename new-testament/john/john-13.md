1 _Before the Passover Feast had started, Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world. The time had come for him to go back to his Father. He loved his own people who were in the world. And he loved them the same way right to the end._

2 _He and his disciples were eating together. The devil had already put it into Judas heart to give Jesus over to people who hated him. (Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot.)_

3 _Jesus knew that his Father had put everything into his hands. He knew he had come from God. He knew he was going back to God._

4 _Jesus stood up where he had been eating. He took off his outer clothing. And he took a towel and tied it around him._

5 _Then he poured water into a pan and began to wash the disciples feet. He wiped their feet with the towel he had tied around him._

6 _He came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet?_

7 _Jesus answered him, You do not understand now what I am doing, but you will understand it later._

8 _Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, then you do not belong to me._

9 _Simon Peter said to him, Lord, wash my feet, and my hands, and my head also!_

10 _Jesus said, A person who has bathed himself needs to wash his feet only. He is all clean.  You are clean, but not all of you._

11 _Jesus knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him. That is why he said, You are not all clean._

12 _After Jesus had finished washing their feet, he took his gown and sat down again. Do you understand what I have done to you? he asked._

13 _You call me Master and Lord. What you say is right. I am your Master and Lord._

14 _I am your Lord and Master and have washed your feet. If I do that, then you should wash one anothers feet._

15 _I have shown you what to do. Now you do as I have done._

16 _I tell you the truth. The servant is not better than his master. The one who is sent is not better than the one who sent him._

17 _Do you understand what I have told you? If you do, you will have much happiness for doing it._

18 _I am not talking about all of you but I know the people I have chosen. So Gods word comes true. The holy writings say, "He who is eating my bread has turned against me."_

19 _I am telling you this now before it happens. So when it happens you will believe who I am._

20 _I tell you the truth. The person who receives the one I send, receives me. He that receives me, receives the one who sent me._

21 _When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in his heart. He said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me._

22 _The disciples looked at one another. They did not know which one of them Jesus was talking about._

23 _The disciple Jesus loved was at his right side._

24 _Simon Peter nodded to that disciple. He said, Tell us who he is talking about._

25 _He who was at Jesus right side said to Jesus, Lord, who is it?_

26 _Jesus answered, I will put a piece of bread in the dish. Then I will give it to that one. He put in the bread, then he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot._

27 _Right after Jesus had given the bread, Satan came into Judas. Then Jesus said to him,  What you are going to do, do right away._

28 _No one at the table knew why Jesus said, Do it right away._

29 _Judas had the money bag. Some thought that Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the feast, or that he wanted Judas to give something to the poor people._

30 _Judas went out right after he had taken the bread. It was night._

31 _When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is very great. And he has made Gods name great._

32 _If he has made Gods name great, God also will make him great by his own power. He will do it right away._

33 _My children, I am with you for a short time longer. You will look for me. What I said to the Jews I say to you now: "You cannot come to the place where I am going."_

34 _I give you a new law. That law is, "Love each other." As I have loved you, so you also love each other._

35 _This is how all people will know that you are my disciples._

36 _Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered him, You cannot go with me where I am going now. Later on you will go with me._

37 _Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not go with you now? I am willing to die for you._

38 _Jesus answered him, Will you die for me? I tell you the truth. Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me._

1 _I saw another big and wonderful thing in the sky. I saw seven angels who carried the seven big troubles. They are the last troubles. When these troubles have come, Gods anger is ended. 2I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. And I saw those people who had won the fight against the beast, and its idol, and its mark, and the number of its name. They were standing on the sea of glass and they had the harps of God in their hands._

2 _They sing the song of Moses who is the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They say, Lord God who has all power, the things you do are great and wonderful! King for ever, your ways are right and true!_

3 _Who will not respect and honour you and praise your name, Lord? You are the only one who is holy. People from all countries will come and worship you because they have seen that you are right and fair._

4 _After this I looked. The temple in heaven was open. It was the place where Gods agreement was kept._

5 _The seven angels who carried the seven troubles came out of the temple. They were wearing linen clothes, clean and shining. Around their chests they wore gold belts._

6 _One of the four living beings gave the angels seven gold bowls. The bowls were full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever._

7 _The temple was full of smoke because God is so great and has so much power. No one could go into the temple until the seven troubles, which the seven angels had, were ended._

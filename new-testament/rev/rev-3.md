1 _Write this to the angel of the church people in Sardis: Here are the words of the one who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars. He says, "I know what you do. People say that you are alive, but you are dead._

2 _Wake up! You still have a little life left in you. Make it stronger before it dies altogether. I have not seen you do anything that looked right to God._

3 _So remember the things you were told and the things you have heard. Obey them. Stop the things you have been doing. If you do not wake up, I will come to you like a thief.  You will not know when I will come to you._

4 _But you have a few people in Sardis who have not made their clothes dirty. They will walk with me in white clothes, because they are good enough._

5 _He who wins will wear white clothes. I will not take his name out of the book of life. I will tell his name to my Father and to his angels."_

6 _He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches._

7 _Write this to the angel of the church people in Philadelphia: Here are the words of the one who is holy and true. He has Davids key. No one will shut what he opens. And no one will open what he shuts._

8 _He says, "I know what you do. Look, I have opened a door in front of you. No one can shut it. I know that you do not have much power. But you have obeyed my word and you have never said you did not believe in me._

9 _Look! I will bring some people who belong to Satans group. They call themselves Jews,  but they are not real Jews. They lie. Look, I will make them come and kneel down in front of you. They will know that I have loved you._

10 _You have obeyed my word and been patient. So I will keep you safe in the time of trouble which will come all over the world. It will test the people who live on earth._

11 _I am coming again soon! Hold on to the faith which you have, so that no one will stop you receiving your reward in heaven._

12 _I will make the person who wins become a strong post in the temple of my God. I will keep him strong. He will never leave it again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my Gods city. This city is the new Jerusalem. It comes down out of heaven from my God. And I will write my new name on him."_

13 _He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches._

14 _Write this to the angel of the church people in Laodicea: Here are the words of the one whose name is Truth. What he says can be trusted. He is the one who began all that God made._

15 _He says, "I know what you do. I know that you are neither cold nor hot. And I wish that you were cold or hot._

16 _So I will spit you out of my mouth, because you are only warm and not hot or cold._

17 _You say, I am rich and have many things. I need nothing. You do not know that you are in trouble and need help. You are poor. You are blind. And you have no clothes to wear._

18 _I tell you what you should do. You should buy from me gold that has been made clean by fire. Then you will be rich. And you should buy from me white clothes to wear. Then people will not see that you have no clothes, and you will not be ashamed. You should buy from me healing oil to put on your eyes. Then you will be able to see._

19 _I tell off and punish the people I love. So get busy and stop doing wrong._

20 _Listen, I stand at the door and knock. If any one hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him. I will eat with him, and he will eat with me._

21 _He who wins will sit with me on my throne in heaven. I won too, and I sat down with my Father on his throne."_

22 _He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches._

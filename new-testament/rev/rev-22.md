1 _Then the angel showed me a river of the water which gives life. It was as clear as glass. It flows from the throne of God and the Lamb._

2 _It flows through the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river is the tree which gives life. It has twelve kinds of fruit, and it bears its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree could heal the people of all nations._

3 _Nothing that God hates will be in the city any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there. And his servants will serve him._

4 _They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads._

5 _There will be no night there. They do not need the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun.  The Lord God will give them light. They will rule for ever and ever._

6 _Then the angel said to me, These words can be trusted. They are true. The Lord God who gave his Spirit to the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon._

7 _Look! I will come soon! God will bless the person who obeys the words in this book._

8 _I, John, heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them I kneeled down to worship in front of the angel who showed them to me._

9 _But He said to me, You must not do that. I am only a servant like you and your brothers,  the prophets, and those who obey the words of this book. Worship God._

10 _The angel said to me, Do not keep secret the words of Gods message in this book. The time is near._

11 _Let the bad man keep on doing wrong things. Let the person who does dirty things, keep on being dirty. Let the good person keep on doing what is good. Let the holy person keep on being holy._

12 _Look, I will come soon! When I come, I will pay every man for what he has done._

13 _I am the First and the Last. I am the Beginning and the End._

14 _God will bless the people who do what he says and keep themselves pure and clean.  They can eat fruit from the tree that gives life. And they can go through the doors into the city._

15 _Outside the city are the dirty people, and the witch-doctors, and those with wrong ways of using sex, those who kill people, those who worship idols, and all those who like lies and tell them._

16 _I, Jesus, have sent my angel to tell these things to you in the churches. I am the root and the branch of David. I am the bright star in the morning._

17 _The Spirit and the Lambs wife say, Come. He who hears should say, Come. He who is thirsty should come. Anyone who wishes should drink the water that gives life. It costs no money._

18 _I am talking to everyone who hears the words of Gods message in this book. If any one adds anything to this book, God will add to him the troubles that are written in this book._

19 _If any one takes away any of the words of Gods message, God will take away from him his share of the tree which gives life and the holy city. This book tells about them._

20 _He who shows these things says, Yes, I will come soon. Amen, Lord Jesus, come!_

21 _May the love and mercy of the Lord Jesus bless you all. Amen._

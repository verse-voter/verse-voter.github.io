1 _I say this before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge people who are living and people who are dead. I say this to you because he will come back and rule over all._

2 _Tell people the word of God. Be ready to do it at any time. Show people they are wrong and talk to them about it. Tell them what they should do. Be very patient with them and teach them in many ways._

3 _The time is coming when people will not listen to good teaching. They will want to listen to the things they like to hear. And they will bring in many teachers who will teach them just what they want to do._

4 _They will not listen to what is true, but will turn away and listen to strange stories._

5 _But you, Timothy, must always be watching. Be patient in your troubles. Tell the good news. Do all the work God has given you to do._

6 _My life is already being poured out as an offering to God. The time is here for me to leave this life._

7 _I have fought the kind of fight that is good. I have reached the mark on the road that God wanted me to reach. And I have kept on believing in him._

8 _From now on, my reward is waiting for me, because I have done what is right. The Lord will repay me on the day when he comes back. He judges the right way. I will not be the only one to get a reward from him. But he will repay all those who want very much to see him._

9 _Try to come to me soon._

10 _Demas has left me because he loved the things of this world. He has gone to the city of Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia._

11 _Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. He helps me very much in my work._

12 _I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus._

13 _I left a coat with Carpus in Troas. Bring it with you when you come, and also bring the books. But most of all, I want the written papers._

14 _Alexander, the man who makes things from copper, did many wrong things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he has done._

15 _You too must keep away from him, for he was very much against what we said._

16 _The first time I spoke for myself in court, no one was on my side. All left me. I hope that God will forgive them._

17 _But the Lord was with me. He gave me strength to tell the message. All those who are not Jews heard it. And I was saved out of the mouth of the lion._

18 _The Lord will save me from every wrong thing. He will bring me safely into the kingdom of heaven. Praise him for ever and ever. Yes, he will!_

19 _Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the people who belong to the house of Onesiphorus._

20 _Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth. Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus._

21 _Try to come before the cold time of the year. Eubulus sends you greetings. So do Pudens, Linus, and Claudia and all the Christian brothers._

22 _The Lord be with your spirit. May he in his kindness bless you. Amen. May it be so!_

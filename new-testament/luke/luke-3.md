Meanwhile, in the desert, a scene of dramatic revelation was unfolding, to John son of Zechariah.  Dunh dunh dunh!

4 _Isaiah, the prophet of God, wrote about him long ago in his book: A man is calling out in the desert: "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him._

5 _Every valley will be filled. Every big hill and every small hill will be cut down flat.  Crooked roads will be made into straight roads. Bad roads will be made into good roads._

7 _Many people came out to John to be baptised. He said to them, You family of snakes!  Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming?_

8 _Do good things that will show you have stopped your wrong ways! Do not begin to say to yourselves, "We are Abrahams children. "I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones._

13 _He said to them, Do not make people pay more money than you are told to._

14 _Some soldiers also asked him, What shall we do? He answered them Do not force people. Do not tell lies about people. Do not want more pay than you get._

15 _The people were waiting to see what would happen. They were all asking about John.  They thought that he might be the Christ, the great king promised by God long ago._

16 _John said to them all, I baptise you with water. But another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings. He will baptise you with the Holy spirit and with fire._

17 _He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never goes out._

18 _By these words and many other ways, he told the people the good news._

19 _John told Herod the ruler that he had done wrong things. He told him he should not have his brothers wife, Herodias. He also told him about all the other wrong things he had done._

20 _Later on Herod did another wrong thing after all those wrong things. He put John in prison._

21 _When all the other people had been baptised, Jesus was also baptised. While he was talking with God, the sky opened._

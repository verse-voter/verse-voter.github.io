1 _Some people were there at that time who told Jesus what Pilate had done. He had killed some of the people of Galilee and put their blood with the blood of their sacrifices to God._

2 _Jesus answered, Do you think it was because they were worse than all the other people in Galilee?_

3 _I tell you, "No!" But if you do not stop doing wrong things, then you will all die as they did._

4 _Eighteen men died when the high house in Siloam fell on them. Do you think they were worse than all the other men who lived in Jerusalem?_

5 _I tell you, "No!" But if you do not stop doing wrong things, you will all die as they did._

6 _Then Jesus told this story: A man had a fruit tree on his farm. He came to look for fruit on it, but did not find any._

7 _He said to the man who cared for the trees, "For three years I have come to look for fruit on this tree, but I have not found any. Cut it down. Why should it spoil my farmland?"_

8 _The man who cared for the trees answered, "Sir, let it stay one more year. I will dig around it and put good soil around it._

9 _If it has fruit on it next year, that will be good. But if it has no fruit, you can have it cut down." _

10 _Jesus was teaching in one of the meeting houses on the Sabbath day._

11 _A woman was there who had a spirit that had made her sick for eighteen years. She had to bend down all the time and could not stand up straight._

12 _Jesus saw her and called her to come to him. Then he said, Woman, you are healed.  You are not sick any longer._

13 _Jesus put his hands on her, and right away she stood up straight. And she praised God._

14 _The ruler of the meeting house was angry because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day.  He said to the people, There are six days to work. You should come to be healed on those days, and not on the Sabbath day._

15 _The Lord said to him, You are not true to yourselves! Every one of you unties his cow or horse and takes it to the water to drink on the Sabbath day. Do you not?_

16 _This woman belongs to Abrahams family. Satan has tied her for eighteen years. Is it not right that she should be set free on the Sabbath day?_

17 _When he said that, all those who had talked against him were ashamed. All the other people were very glad for all the wonderful things Jesus did._

18 _He went on to say, What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like?_

19 _It is like this. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field. It grew up big like a tree. The birds came and lived in its branches._

20 _Then Jesus said again, What else is the kingdom of God like?_

21 _It is like this. A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour. The yeast went all through the flour._

22 _Jesus went through the towns and villages on the way to Jerusalem. He was teaching the people as he went._

23 _A man asked him, Sir, will only a few people be saved?_

24 _Jesus answered, Try hard to go in by the small gate. I tell you, many will want to go in but they will not be able._

25 _The master of the house will get up and lock the door. Then you will be standing outside.  You will begin to knock on the door and call, "Sir, open the door for us!" But he will answer, "I do not know where you belong."_

26 _Then you will say, "We ate and drank with you. You taught in our streets."_

27 _But he will say, "I tell you, I do not know where you belong. Go away from me all you who do wrong! "_

28 _You will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God.  And you will see yourselves thrown out. Then you will cry and make a noise with your teeth._

29 _People will come from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south. They will sit down to eat in the kingdom of God._

30 _Yes, some people who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last._

31 _At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus. They said to him, Go away from here.  Herod wants to kill you._

32 _He said, Go and tell that fox, "I drive bad spirits out of people and heal people. I do it today and tomorrow. On the third day I will finish what I am doing."_

33 _But I must go on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day. A prophet of God cannot be killed outside of Jerusalem._

34 _O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You kill the prophets of God. You throw stones to kill men who are sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your people together as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings. But you would not come!_

35 _Now you are left alone in your house. I tell you this. You will not see me again until the time when you say, "God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord." _

1 _On the first day of the week, early in the morning, the women went to the grave. They took with them the things they had made ready._

2 _They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave._

3 _So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus._

4 _They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes._

5 _The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, Why do you look for a living person among dead people?_

6 _He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee._

7 _He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day._

8 _Then they remembered what he had said._

9 _They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people._

10 _The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them._

11 _But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened._

12 _That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem._

13 _They were talking together about all the things that had happened._

14 _While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them._

15 _But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was._

16 _Jesus asked them, What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?_

17 _One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?_

18 _Jesus said, What things?" They said, All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people._

19 _Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross._

20 _But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it._

21 _Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave._

22 _They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living._

23 _Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus._

24 _Then he said to them, You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago._

25 _Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?_

26 _Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him._

27 _They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further._

28 _But they begged him not to go further. They said, Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished. So he went in to stay with them._

29 _He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them._

30 _Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more._

31 _They said to each other, It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!_

32 _They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them._

33 _These people said, The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!_

34 _Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them._

35 _While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them,  Peace to you!_

36 _They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit._

37 _He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts?_

38 _Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have._

39 _They gave him a piece of cooked fish._

40 _He took the fish and ate it in front of them._

41 _Then he said, I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true._

42 _Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings._

43 _He said, It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death._

44 _Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem._

45 _You are the men who have seen these things, and will tell people about them._

46 _I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God._

47 _Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them._

48 _While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven._

49 _They bowed down and worshipped him. They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem._

50 _Every day they were in the temple praising God._

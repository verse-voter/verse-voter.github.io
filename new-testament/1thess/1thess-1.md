3 _My brothers, God loves you and we know that he has chosen you._

4 _The good news we brought you was not just words. It had power. It had the Holy Spirit.  It made people very sure it was true. And you also know how we lived when we were with you to help you._

5 _You tried hard to be like us and like the Lord. You had much trouble because you believed our message. Yet the Holy Spirit made you very happy._

6 _You have shown all the Christians in the countries of Macedonia and Greece how they should live._

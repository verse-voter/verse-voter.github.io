1 _My brothers, you yourselves know that our visit to you was not for nothing._

2 _The people at the city of Philippi treated us very badly. As you know, we had much trouble. But God helped us, and we did not fear to tell you Gods good news. But many things were against us and tried to stop us._

3 _Our message was not a lie. What we told you was not wrong. And we did not try to fool you._

4 _But God chose us to tell people the good news. And so we do not speak to please men,  but to please God. He is the one who knows what is in our hearts._

5 _We never said nice things about people that were not true. You know this. We never talked to get something out of it for ourselves. God knows this._

6 _And we did not ask you or anybody else to help us or to praise us. Of course, we are apostles of Christ, and we had the right to do so._

7 _But we were kind when we were with you. We were like a woman taking care of her own children._

8 _Because we loved you, we were glad to give you Gods good news. We were also glad to give you our lives, because we loved you very much._

9 _My brothers, you remember how hard we worked. We worked night and day so that we would not trouble any of you. And we told you Gods good news._

10 _We lived in a holy and right way among you Christians. We did nothing wrong to you.  You know this yourselves and God knows it too._

11 _You know how we talked to each of you as a father talks to his children. We comforted,  helped, and taught you._

12 _We told you to live to please God. He called you to his own kingdom and greatness._

13 _And here is another reason why we always thank God all the time. When you heard Gods word from us, you did not say, That is mens word. But you said, That is Gods word. And it really is Gods word. The word is working in you Christians._

14 _My brothers, you were like the churches of God in Judea which belong to Christ Jesus.  The people of your own country troubled you in the same way that the Jews troubled them._

15 _The Jewish leaders killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets. And they drove us out of their country. They do not please God and they are against all other people._

16 _They try to stop us from talking to those people who are not Jews. They do not want them to be saved. So they are always doing wrong things. And now at last, God has become very angry with them. have been away from you for a short time in body, but not in heart. We wanted very much to see you face to face, and we tried hard to come._

17 _We wanted to come to you. Twice, I, Paul, wanted to come. But Satan stopped us._

18 _What is our hope when our Lord Jesus comes? What will make us happy and proud then? It is you people!_

19 _You are ones of whom we are proud. You make us happy._

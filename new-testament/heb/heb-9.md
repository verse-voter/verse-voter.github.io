1 _The first agreement had laws about worship. And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept._

2 _A house was made. In the first part of the house were the light, the table, and the bread of God. This first part was called the Holy Place._

3 _The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place._

4 _In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold. In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke. The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place. It was covered all over with gold. In this box were: the golden pot, which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aarons stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had Gods agreement written on them._

5 _On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now._

6 _These things were made ready. The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God._

7 _But only the high priest went into the second part. And he went in only once a year. He never went in without taking blood with him. He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done._

8 _This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody. It was not open as long as the first house was still standing._

9 _This first part is a picture of the time we are in now. In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God. But they cannot make a persons heart clean to worship God._

10 _These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings. They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again._

11 _But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come. He went through a greater and better house which was not made by mens hands. It is not a part of this world._

12 _He did not take the blood of goats and young cows. He took his own blood. And he went into the Most Holy Place just once. He paid for our sins and made us free for ever._

13 _The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned. He puts this on the people who have done wrong things. This makes their bodies clean._

14 _If the blood of animals can do that, then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better. Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice. He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever. He was a perfect sacrifice. He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship.  Then we can serve the living God._

15 _That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement. He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement. Because he is a middle man, those people who are called by God can have what he promised. This will belong to them for ever._

16 _A person can say who will get his things when he dies. He writes this agreement down.  Before anyone can have them, it must be proved that the person has died._

17 _The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died. It has no power as long as the one who made it is living._

18 _So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood._

19 _Moses told all the people every part of the law. Then he took the blood of young cows and goats. He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people.  He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop._

20 _As he did this, he said, This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you._

21 _In the same way, he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God, and on all the things that were used in worship._

22 _Yes, by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood. If no animal is killed to give blood, then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done._

23 _These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like. The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals. But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these._

24 _Christ did not go into a holy place made by mens hands. The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like. He went into heaven itself.  Now he stands before God for our sake._

25 _Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times. He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood._

26 _If Christ were like him, he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made. But as it is now, Christ came once in the last days of the world. He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice._

27 _People must die, and after that they will be judged._

28 _So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once. He took on himself the wrong things many people have done. He will come a second time. But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done. He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him._

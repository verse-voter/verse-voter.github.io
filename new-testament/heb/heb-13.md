1 _Keep on loving your Christian brothers._

2 _Take strangers to your home and care for them. Some people who have done this found out the strangers were angels._

3 _Remember those who are in prison as if you were in prison with them. And remember those who are having troubles, as if you were having the same troubles._

4 _Everyone must respect marriage. And the bed must be kept clean. God will punish those who use their bodies for wrong sex._

5 _Do not let the love of money control your life. Be satisfied with what you have. God himself has said, I will never be away from you. I will never leave you alone._

6 _So we can be strong and say, The Lord will help me. I will not be afraid. What can men do to me?_

7 _Remember your leaders. They have told you the word of God. Think about the way they lived and died, and keep on believing as they did._

8 _Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and for ever._

9 _Do not listen to all kinds of different teaching and strange things. It is better to have a heart that is strong because of Gods blessing than a heart that is thinking about different kinds of food. Different kinds of food do not help people who put their trust in them._

10 _We have a sacrifice. But priests who serve God on earth have no right to eat from this sacrifice._

11 _The high priest takes into the Most Holy Place the blood of animals that are sacrificed.  He gives it to God to pay for the wrong things people have done. The bodies of these animals are burned outside the town._

12 _So also Jesus was put to death outside the town. Then he could make the people holy by his own blood._

13 _So let us go to him outside the town and take the shame as he did._

14 _Here we do not have a city that will last for ever, but we are looking for the city that will come._

15 _Let us always give a sacrifice of praise to God through Jesus. We do it by thanking him for all that he has done and also by talking about him. That is the sacrifice we make with our lips to his name._

16 _But do not forget to do good things for people, and to give what you have to those who need it. These are sacrifices that please God._

17 _Obey your leaders and do what they tell you. They are watching over your souls. They must give a report. Obey them so they will be glad, and not sad, to give a report. If you make them sad, it is no help to you._

18 _Talk to God about us. We know that what we do is right. We want to do what is right in every way._

19 _Here is why I want very much that you talk to God about me. If you do, I will be free to come to you sooner._

20 _God gives peace. He brought back our Lord Jesus from death. Our Lord Jesus cares for Gods people and he gave his blood for the agreement that stands for ever._

21 _May God give you everything good so that you will do what he wants you to do. He will do in us, through Jesus Christ, what pleases him. Praise him for ever. May it be so!_

22 _Please, brothers, be patient with the words I have given to help you. I have written a short letter._

23 _I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free. If he comes here soon, I will come with him to see you._

24 _Greet all your leaders and all of Gods people. Those who belong to the country of Italy send you greetings._

25 _May Gods loving kindness be with you all. Amen! May it be so!_

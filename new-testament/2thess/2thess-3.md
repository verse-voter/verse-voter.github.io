1 _My brothers, please talk to God about us. Ask God that the Lords message may reach many people quickly and that they may receive it gladly as you did._

2 _Ask God that we may be saved from bad people who do wrong things. Not everyone believes in Christ._

3 _But the Lord can be trusted. He will make you strong. He will keep you safe from all that is wrong._

4 _The Lord makes us feel sure about you. We are sure that you are doing, and will do,  what we tell you to do._

5 _May the Lord lead you to love God and be patient like Christ._

6 _Now, my brothers, we tell you to do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Have nothing to do with any lazy brother who is not living the way we taught you._

7 _You yourselves know how you should be like us. We were not lazy when we were with you._

8 _We did not eat anyones food without paying for it. But we worked very hard day and night because we did not want to trouble any one of you._

9 _We have the right to be helped. But we wanted to show you what you should do in this matter._

10 _Even when we were with you, we told you this, If any man will not work, do not let him eat._

11 _We hear that some of you are lazy. You do not work, but you trouble other people._

12 _We say to such lazy people, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Do your work quietly.  Earn your own food._

13 _My brothers, do not get tired of doing what is good._

14 _If any one will not obey what we say in this letter, look at that man and remember him.  Have nothing to do with him, so that he will be ashamed._

15 _Do not treat him like an enemy. Tell him, as you would tell a brother, what he should do._

16 _The Lord gives peace. May he give his peace to you at all times in every way. May the Lord be with you all._

17 _I, Paul, write these words of greeting with my own hand. This is the sign in all my letters that I wrote them._

18 _The loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all._

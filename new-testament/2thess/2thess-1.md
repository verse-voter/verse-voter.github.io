1 _Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy send greetings to the church people in the city of Thessalonica. This church belongs to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._

2 _May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, in their kindness, give you much happiness and peace._

3 _My brothers, we thank God for you always. It is the right thing to do. You trust him more and more. You all love each other more and more._

4 _So we are proud of you. We tell the churches of God about you because you are standing strong and you keep on believing in God. Your troubles and hard times do not stop you._

5 _This proves that God will judge right. And he will say that you are good enough for the kingdom of God because you suffer for it._

6 _God will do what is right. He will give trouble to those who are troubling you._

7 _And he will give rest to you who are having troubles, and to us also. He will give this rest when our Lord Jesus comes back from heaven. The Lord Jesus will come with his strong angels in flaming fire._

8 _He will punish those who do not know God, and those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus._

9 _They will be destroyed for ever. That will be their punishment. They will be for ever separated from the Lord and from his great and wonderful power._

10 _This will happen on the day he comes. On that day his people will show how great and wonderful he is. And all those who have believed in him will be surprised at how great he is. That means you also, because you believed what we told you._

11 _That is why we always talk to God about you. We want our God to make you fit for the good work to which he called you. We ask him to finish his good work of faith which trusts in his power._

12 _In that way you will make the name of our Lord Jesus Christ great. And he will make you great. This will be because of the kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ._

1 _My brothers, you believe in our Lord, the wonderful Jesus Christ. So you must not think one man is better than another._

2 _A man comes in to your church meeting. He has a gold ring and wears fine clothes. A poor man also comes in. He wears old clothes._

3 _You look at the man who wears fine clothes. And you say to him, Sit here on this good chair. But you say to the poor man, Stand over there, or you say, Sit on the floor by my feet._

4 _If you do these things, you think some people are better than others. You are wrong when you judge people this way._

5 _Listen, my dear brothers. God has chosen people who are poor in this world. They believe very much. They will have a place in the kingdom which he has promised to give to those who love him._

6 _But you made the poor man ashamed. Is it not the rich people who trouble you? Are not they the ones who take you to court?_

7 _Are not they the ones who say wrong things about the good name you have?_

8 _The holy writings say, Love your neighbour as you love yourself. If you obey this law of your King you do well._

9 _But if you think one man is better than another, that is wrong. The law says you are a bad person._

10 _Anyone who obeys the law, but then breaks one of the laws, has broken all the laws._

11 _God made the law, Do not use sex wrongly. God also made the law, Do not kill.If you do not have wrong sex, but you kill, you have broken the law._

12 _There is a law that makes people free. It is the law of showing kindness. Always talk and live like men who will be judged by that law._

13 _When God judges, he will not be kind to a person who has not been kind. It is better to be kind than it is to judge people._

14 _My brothers, perhaps a man says, I believe. What good is that if he does not do anything? Can just believing save him?_

15 _Perhaps a brother or a sister needs clothes and has no food._

16 _Perhaps one of you says to them, God bless you. Be warm. Eat all you want. But what good is that if you do not give them what they need for their bodies?_

17 _Believing is like that. If it does not do anything it is no good. Belief by itself is dead._

18 _In that case someone may say, You believe. And I do good things. Try to show me that you believe without doing any acts of kindness. I will show you that I believe by doing acts of kindness._

19 _You believe that there is one God. That is right. But even the bad spirits believe that. And they shake with fear._

20 _You are foolish! Believing is no good if it does not do anything good. Do you want to know that for sure?_

21 _Look at Abraham. God called our father Abraham a good man. This was because he gave his son Isaac to God on the holy table for a sacrifice._

22 _You can see he believed. His faith and the things he did worked together. His believing was made all right because he did something._

23 _The words of the holy writings came true. They say, Abraham believed God. And he was called a good man because of it. In another place he was called Gods friend._

24 _You see, a man is a good man because of the things he does, and not just because he believes._

25 _Rahab was a bad woman. But in the same way God called her a good woman because of something she did. She took the men into her house and then let them go out another way._

26 _A body is dead if it does not breathe. In the same way, believing is dead if it does not do anything good._

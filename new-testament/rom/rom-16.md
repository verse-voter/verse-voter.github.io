1 _I want to tell you good things about our sister Phoebe. She helps in the church in Cenchrea._

2 _I want you to take her in because she is a Christian. That is what Gods people should do.  Help her in any way she needs help. She has helped many people and has helped me too._

3 _I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, who worked with me for Christ Jesus._

4 _They almost died to save me. I am not the only one who thanks them. All the churches who are not Jews thank them also._

5 _Give my greetings also to the church in their house. Give my greetings also to dear Epaenetus. He was the first person in Asia Minor to believe in Christ._

6 _Give my greetings to Mary. She worked hard to help us._

7 _Give my greetings to Andronicus and Junia. They belong to my family. We were in prison together. The apostles think they are good men. They were Christians before I was._

8 _Give my greetings to Amplias. I love him because he is a Christian._

9 _Give my greetings to Urbanus. He worked with us for Christ. Give my greetings to dear Stachys also._

10 _Give my greetings to Apelles. He has proved himself to be a Christian. Give my greetings to the family of Aristobulus._

11 _Give my greetings to Herodion. He belongs to my family. Give my greetings to the family of Narcissus. They are Christians._

12 _Give my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa. They worked for the Lord. Give my greetings to dear Persis. She has worked hard for the Lord._

13 _Give my greetings to Rufus. The Lord chose him. Give my greetings also to his mother who is like a mother to me._

14 _Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them._

15 _Give my greetings to Philologus, Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all Gods people who are with them._

16 _Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the Christian churches send greetings to you._

17 _Brothers, I ask you to do this. Watch the people who make quarrels. They make people do wrong because they teach things you have not been taught. Have nothing to do with those people._

18 _Those people do not work for our Lord Jesus Christ. They work only for themselves.  With their words of praise they fool people who do not know what is wrong._

19 _People everywhere know that you obey. I am very happy about you. I want you to be wise and know what is right. I want you to know nothing about what is wrong._

20 _God gives peace. He will soon crush Satan under your feet. May our Lord Jesus Christ bless you._

21 _Timothy sends you greetings. He worked with me. Luke, Jason, and Sosipater send you greetings. They belong to my family._

22 _(I, Tertius, send you Christian greetings. I am writing this letter for Paul.)_

23 _Gaius sends you greetings. I am staying in his house. The whole church that meets in his house sends you greetings too. Erastus sends greetings to you. He takes care of the money for the city. Our brother Quartus sends you greetings._

24 _I ask our Lord Jesus Christ to show you his loving kindness. He will!_

25 _Praise God! He is able to make you stand firm. That is the good news that I tell. That is what the message about Jesus Christ says. The message was kept secret for a long time in the past. But it has now been made known._

26 _The books of the prophets have told this message. The God who lives for ever told the prophets to write this message so that all the people who are not Jews will believe and obey._

27 _God is the only one who is wise. Praise him for ever because of Jesus Christ. Yes, it is so!_

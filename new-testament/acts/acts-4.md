1 _Peter and John were talking to the people. The priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them._

2 _They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people. They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death._

3 _They caught them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening._

4 _But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God, believed what they said.  The number of men who believed was about five thousand._

5 _The next day their rulers, leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem._

6 _Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all of the high priests family were there also._

7 _Peter and John were brought before them. They asked the apostles, By what power or in what name have you done this?_

8 _Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel, have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man? Do you want to find out how he was healed?_

10 _Well, let it be known by all the people of Israel. This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He has done this. You nailed him to a cross, but God raised him from death._

11 _Jesus Christ is the stone which you, the builders, would not use. But he is now the chief corner stone._

12 _No one else can save us. Of all the people in the world, God chose him to save us. It is by him we must be saved._

13 _They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out. They knew that they were like any other men. They did not have much training. So the people were very much surprised. They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus._

14 _They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them. So they could say nothing against them._

15 _They told Peter and John to leave the court. Then they talked the matter over among themselves._

16 _They said, What shall we do to these men? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done. And we cannot say they did not do it._

17 _But we do not want any more people to hear about it. So let us say to these men, "Take care! Never speak to anyone in this name again." _

18 _They called them in and said, Never speak or teach in this name again._

19 _But Peter and John answered them, How does God look at it? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him? You judge that for yourselves._

20 _As for us, we must tell the things we have seen and heard._

21 _So the high priest and those with him told them again. Then they let them go. They could not punish them because of the people. They all praised God for what had been done._

22 _The man who had been healed was more than forty years old._

23 _When they were free, Peter and John went back to their own friends. They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them._

24 _When they heard it, they talked to God together. They said, Lord, you are God. You made the sky, and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them._

25 _Our father David was your servant. Through him you said by the Holy Spirit, "Why are the people who are not Jews so angry? And why do the people plan things for nothing?_

26 _The kings of the earth joined their forces. And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ."_

27 _It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city. They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus, whom you made Christ._

28 _But they only did what you had already planned should be done._

29 _Lord, hear their words. Listen to the wrong things they say against us. We are your servants. Help us to speak your word without fear. And heal the sick by your own power.  Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus._

31 _When they had talked to God, the room they were in shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. And they spoke the word of God without fear._

32 _All the believers were one in heart and mind. Not one of them said, This is mine. But everything they had was for the use of all._

33 _With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death. And God blessed them all very much._

34 _None of them was in need of anything. Those who owned fields and houses sold them.  They brought the money to the apostles. Then the apostles gave each one what he needed._

36 _There was a man named Joseph, a Levite. He was born in the country of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. That means "one who helps."_

37 _He had a field and sold it. He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them._

1 _Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers. They said, You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us. If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved._

2 _Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them. There was much talking about it. Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem. They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it._

3 _So the church people sent them on their way. They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria. They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God. This news made all the Christian brothers very happy._

4 _When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church people, the apostles,  and the church leaders. They told all that God had done as he worked with them._

5 _But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said, They must be circumcised like the Jews . We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses._

6 _The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over._

7 _After much talking about it, Peter stood up. He said, Men and brothers, you know what happened in the first days. God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews. They believed._

8 _God knows what is in a persons heart. He proved that they believed. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us._

9 _God made no difference between them and us. He made their hearts clean when they believed._

10 _So now why are you doing what God did not do? You give the disciples a hard thing to do. Our fathers could not do it. And we cannot do it._

11 _We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind. And that is why he saves them._

12 _Then all the people stopped talking. They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say.  They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews._

13 _When they had finished talking, James said, Men and brothers, listen to me._

14 _Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews. God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people._

15 _This is what the prophets of God said long ago._

16 _They said, "After this, I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down. I will take the broken pieces and build a house again._

17 _Then all the other people will find God, even those who are not Jews but who belong to me. So says the Lord, who is doing all these things."_

18 _He told us these things long ago._

19 _So now, this is what I think. We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God._

20 _We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do. They must not eat food that has been given to idols. They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife. They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. They must not taste blood._

21 _Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city.  They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day._

22 _Then the apostles, and the leaders, and all the church people chose men from among themselves. They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas,  whose other name was Barsabbas, and Silas. They were leaders among the Christian brothers._

23 _They sent a letter with them. It said, The apostles, the church leaders, and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia._

24 _We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you. They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things. They said, "You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law." We did not tell them to teach you this._

25 _All of us gathered here have chosen some men. We are sending them with our dear brothers, Barnabas and Paul._

26 _Barnabas and Paul have been willing to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ._

27 _We are sending Judas and Silas. They will tell you the same things that we have written in the letter._

28 _The Holy Spirit and we thought it was not good to give you a hard thing to do. But here is what you must not do._

29 _You must not eat food that has been given to idols. You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. You must not taste blood. You must not commit adultery. If you keep away from these things, you will do well. Goodbye._

30 _So the men left and went to Antioch. There they called the people together and gave them the letter._

31 _When the people read the letter, they were very glad. It helped them to become stronger in what they believed._

32 _Judas and Silas were prophets. They said many things to the Christian brothers and helped them to believe more strongly._

33 _They stayed there for a while. Then the brothers sent them back to those who had sent them. They sent a greeting of peace with them._

34 _But Silas thought it was good to stay at Antioch._

35 _Paul and Barnabas stayed there too. They taught the people and told them the Lords message. Many other men did this also._

36 _Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have told the Lords message. Let us see how they are doing._

37 _Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them._

38 _But Paul did not think that they should take him. John Mark had left them when they were at Pamphylia. He had not gone along with them to do the work._

39 _The feeling about this matter was very strong between Barnabas and Paul, so they did not go together. Barnabas took Mark and went in a boat to Cyprus._

40 _Paul chose Silas. The Christian brothers asked the Lord to bless Paul. Then he went on his way._

41 _Paul travelled through Syria and Cilicia. He helped the church people to believe more strongly._

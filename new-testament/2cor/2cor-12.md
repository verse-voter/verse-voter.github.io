1 _I must talk about myself even though it does no good. I will talk about visions and things which the Lord has shown me._

2 _I know a Christian man. Fourteen years ago he was taken up into the place where God lives. I do not know if he was in his body when he went or not. God knows if he was._

3 _I do know this. He was taken up into the place where God lives. And again I say, I do not know if he was in his body or not. God knows if he was._

4 _This man heard things which cannot be told. No person on earth can speak them._

5 _I will talk about such a man. But I will not talk about myself. If I do talk, it will be about the ways I am weak._

6 _Now if I wanted to talk about myself, I would not be foolish. I would be telling the truth.  But I will not say any more. This is why: I do not want anyone to think I am better than what he sees I am, or hears me teach. I want him to judge me only by what he can see in me and by what I say._

7 _Because the things God showed me were so wonderful, I might have become too proud of myself. But something happened and stopped that. It was like a thorn in me. It came from Satan the devil to trouble me. It came to stop me from being too proud._

8 _I begged the Lord three times that this trouble might leave me._

9 _But he said to me, My kindness and strength is enough for you. When you are weak, my power is strong. So then, I am very glad to talk about how weak I am so that the power of Christ may live in me._

10 _So then, for the sake of Christ I am glad to be weak, to have people say wrong things about me, to be poor, to have people trouble me, and to have hard times. When I am weak, that is the time I am really strong, have been acting like one with no sense, but you have made me do it. You should have been talking about the good things I have done.  The very best apostles are not one bit better than I am, even though I am nothing at all._

11 _There are signs that show a true apostle. I did all these things when I was among you.  There were signs, wonderful works, and other big works which I did. You saw the power of God, even though I was being tested._

12 _In what way did you not receive as much as the other churches? Only this! I did not trouble you to pay me. Forgive me for the wrong I did you!_

13 _Now, I am ready to come to you for the third time. And I will not trouble you to pay me.  I do not want what belongs to you, but I want you. The children should not save up for their parents, but the parents should do it for their children._

14 _For my part, I am glad to spend what I have, and to spend myself for the sake of your souls. But it seems to me that the more I love you the less you love me!_

15 _All right then, I did not trouble you for any money. But some of you think that I have been mean and played a trick on you._

16 _Did I send anyone to you to get something for myself? No!_

17 _I asked Titus to go and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus get anything for himself?  No! Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?_

18 _Am I saying all this just to you? Are we just trying to make ourselves look right to you?  No, we say this before God and in Christ. And my dear people, I have done it all to make you better Christians._

19 _I want to be pleased with you when I come. But I am afraid I will not be. And I am afraid that you will not be pleased with me. I fear that I may find quarrelling, jealousy, anger,  and that I will find you are enemies to each other, that you are spoiling each others names, that you are telling stories about each other, that you are proud and do not obey rulers._

20 _And I am afraid that when I come my God will make me ashamed of you. I am afraid that my heart will be very sad about you. Many have been doing wrong things for a long time. Many have not turned away from their dirty ways, their wrong use of sex, and the things they should be ashamed of._

1 _When Jesus saw the many people, he went up on a hill. He sat down and his disciples came to him._

2 _He began to teach the people._

3 _He said, God makes happy those who know that they need him. The kingdom of heaven is for them._

4 _God makes happy those who are sad. They will have comfort._

5 _God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way. The world will belong to them._

6 _God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good. They will be filled._

7 _God makes happy those who are kind. He will be kind to them._

8 _God makes happy those who have clean hearts. They will see God._

9 _God makes happy those who make peace between people. They will be called Gods sons._

10 _God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is for them._

11 _God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you, when they trouble you,  and when they say all kinds of lies about you. God makes you happy when it is for my sake._

12 _Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven. In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time._

13 _You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?  Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road._

14 _You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden._

15 _So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp. Then all the people in the house can see its light._

16 _So, let your light shine to all people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven._

17 _Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets. No,  I have not come to take them away. But I have come to do what they say must be done._

18 _I tell you the truth. Until the sky and the earth are taken away, not one small part of the law will be taken away, until everything has been done._

19 _So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws, and teaches other people not to obey it, will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven. But any one who obeys and teaches the law, will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven._

20 _I tell you, you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees. If you do not, then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven._

21 _You have heard this said to men long ago, "Do not kill. Anyone who kills will be judged in court."_

22 _But I tell you this. Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason,  will be judged in court. Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court. Anyone who says "You fool!" will be judged to go into hell fire._

23 _Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar. There you remember that your brother has something against you._

24 _If so, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go to your brother and make things right with him. Then come and give your gift to God._

25 _If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way.  If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison._

26 _I tell you the truth, you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money._

27 _You have heard that the law says, "Do not commit adultery have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife ."_

28 _But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her, then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart._

29 _If your right eye makes you do wrong, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell._

30 _If your right hand makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire._

31 _The law said, "Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife."_

32 _But I tell you, no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery. If he does send her away, he is making her commit adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband, he commits adultery._

33 _Also you have heard this said to men long ago, "You must not make a promise in Gods name and break it." And, "You must do for the Lord what you said you would do."_

34 _But I tell you, do not make a promise in Gods name. Do not use the name of heaven,  because that is where God rules._

35 _Do not use the name of earth, because that is where God rests his feet. Do not use the name of Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King._

36 _Do not make a promise by your head, because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black._

37 _You must mean "Yes" when you say "Yes". You must mean "No" when you say "No".  To say anything more than that is wrong._

38 _You have heard that the law says, "Take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."_

39 _But I tell you, do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you. But if someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side to him also._

40 _If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat also._

41 _If anyone wants you to help carry a load, go with him twice as far._

42 _When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When someone wants to borrow something from you, let him have it._

43 _You have heard that the law says, "Love your neighbour and hate your enemy."_

44 _But I tell you, love your enemies. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you._

45 _In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people. He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong._

46 _If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that._

47 _Do you speak to your brothers only? If so, you are not doing any better than other people. Even people who do not believe in God do that._

48 _You must be good in every way, as your Father in heaven is good in every way._

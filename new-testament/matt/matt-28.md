1 _The Sabbath day was past. Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave._

2 _The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it._

3 _His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow._

4 _The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men._

5 _The angel talked to the women. He said, Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus,  who was nailed to a cross._

6 _He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay._

7 _Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there." Now, I have told you._

8 _The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy.  They ran to tell his disciples._

9 _As they were going, Jesus met them. He said Greetings! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet._

10 _Then Jesus said to them, Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there._

11 _While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city. They told the chief priests all that had happened._

12 _The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over.  They gave much money to the soldiers._

13 _They said, Tell the people, "His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping."_

14 _If the ruler hears about this, then we will talk to him so that he will not punish you._

15 _The soldiers took the money. They did as they were told to do. And even to this day,  many of the Jewish leaders say this is what happened to Jesus._

16 _The eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the hill where Jesus had told them to meet him._

17 _When they saw him, they bowed down in front of him. But some people were not sure._

18 _Jesus came and talked to them. He said, All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me._

19 _So go and make disciples in all countries. Baptise them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit._

20 _Teach them to do all the things I have told you to do. I am with you always, even to the end of time._

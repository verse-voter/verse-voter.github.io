1 _When Jesus had finished telling all these things, he talked to his disciples._

2 _He said, You know that after two days it will be time for the Passover Feast. The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross._

3 _Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas._

4 _They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed._

5 _But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it._

6 _When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease._

7 _While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus head._

8 _When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, Why was the oil wasted like that?_

9 _The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people._

10 _When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me._

11 _You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you._

12 _She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried._

13 _I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it._

14 _Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests._

15 _He said, What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money._

16 _And from then on, Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus. Supper_

17 _It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?_

18 _He said, Go into the city to a certain man. Say to him, "The Teacher says, My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast."_

19 _The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready._

20 _When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples._

21 _As they were eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me._

22 _They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, Lord, is it I?_

23 _Jesus answered them, The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over._

24 _The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!_

25 _Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him. He said,  Master, is it I? Jesus said, Yes, it is._

26 _As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body._

27 _He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, All of you drink from this._

28 _This is my blood. My blood is the blood of the new agreement. It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did._

29 _I tell you this. I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again, until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom._

30 _They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives._

31 _Then Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."_

32 _But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you._

33 _Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you._

34 _Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This night, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me._

35 _Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! All the disciples said the same thing._

36 _Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God._

37 _He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled._

38 _He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me._

39 _Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done._

40 _Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?_

41 _Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak._

42 _Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want._

43 _Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open._

44 _He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words._

45 _Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?  The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people._

46 _Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!_

47 _As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them._

48 _The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him._

49 _Right then he went to Jesus and said, Greetings, Master! And he kissed him._

50 _Jesus said to him, Friend, why have you come? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him._

51 _One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear._

52 _Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword._

53 _Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?_

54 _But then, how would Gods word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be._

55 _At that same time Jesus said to the people, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught.  But you did not try to catch me then._

56 _All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.  Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away._

57 _The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house._

58 _Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end._

59 _The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him._

60 _But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came._

61 _They said, This man said, "I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days." _

62 _The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you._

63 _But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?_

64 _Jesus answered him, Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!_

65 _Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said._

66 _What do you think? They said, He should be killed._

67 _Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands._

68 _They said, Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!_

69 _Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, You were also with Jesus of Galilee._

70 _But Peter said in front of them all, I do not know what you are talking about._

71 _Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth._

72 _Peter said some bad words and then said, I do not know the man._

73 _A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk._

74 _Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, I do not know the man! Right then, a cock called._

75 _Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me. Then Peter went out and cried very much._

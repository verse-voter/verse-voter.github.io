1 _They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people._

2 _There were graves in that place. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man came from among the graves to meet him. The man had a bad spirit in him._

3 _The man lived among the graves. No person could tie him, not even with chains._

4 _Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains. But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces. No person was strong enough to hold the man._

5 _All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were. He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones._

6 _Jesus was still far from him, but when he saw Jesus he ran to him. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him._

7 _He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the High God, what are you going to do to me? I beg you not to hurt me._

8 _He said this because Jesus had said to him, You bad spirit, come out of the man._

9 _Jesus asked, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army, for we are many._

10 _He begged Jesus saying, Do not send us out of the country._

11 _Many pigs were feeding on the hill there._

12 _The bad spirits begged Jesus saying, Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them._

13 _Jesus let them go right away. The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs.  The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water. The number of pigs was about two thousand._

14 _Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away. They told the people in the city and all around the country about it. The people went out to see what had happened._

15 _They came to Jesus. They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him. He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid._

16 _Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits. And they told about the pigs._

17 _Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country._

18 _So Jesus got into the boat again. The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him._

19 _But Jesus did not let him. He said, Go home. Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you. Tell them that he has helped you._

20 _So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him.  All the people were surprised._

21 _Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side. Many people came to him while he was near the water._

22 _One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him. His name was Jairus. When he saw Jesus, he kneeled down before him._

23 _He said, My little daughter is dying. I beg you, come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live._

24 _So Jesus went with Jairus. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him._

25 _A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time._

26 _Many doctors tried to heal her. She spent all the money she had to pay them. She was not better, but was getting worse._

27 _When she heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind him. Then she reached out and touched his clothes._

28 _She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well._

29 _The bleeding stopped right away. She could feel that she was healed of her trouble._

30 _Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him. He turned around among the people and said, Who touched my clothes?_

31 _But his disciples said to him, You see all these people pushing around you. Why do you ask, "Who touched me?" _

32 _He looked around to see who had done it._

33 _The woman was afraid and trembled. She knew what had happened to her. She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself._

34 _He said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled. You are healed._

35 _While Jesus was still talking, some people came from the rulers house. They said, Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any more?_

36 _Jesus heard it. He said to the ruler, Do not fear. Only believe._

37 _Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter, James, and his brother John._

38 _They came to the rulers house. Jesus saw that there was trouble. People were crying and making much noise because the rulers daughter had died._

39 _When he came into the house, he said to them, Why do you make so much noise and cry? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping._

40 _They laughed at him. So he sent them all outside. Then he took the girls father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying._

41 _He took her hand and said, Talitha cumi! That means, Little girl, I tell you, get up!_

42 _The girl got up right away and walked around. She was twelve years old. The people were very much surprised._

43 _Jesus said, Do not tell anyone about this. Give the girl something to eat._

1 _They came to Bethphage and Bethany, near Jerusalem by the hill called Olives. Then he sent two of his disciples ahead._

2 _He said, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find an animal tied. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it and bring it to me._

3 _If anyone asks you, "Why are you doing this?" tell him, "The Lord needs it. He will send it back soon." _

4 _The disciples went. They found the animal tied outside a door in the street. They untied it._

5 _People standing there said, What are you doing, untying the animal?_

6 _The disciples said what Jesus had told them to say. So they let them go._

7 _They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. He got on it._

8 _Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves and branches from the fields and put them on the road._

9 _People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise God! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord!_

10 _God bless the kingdom of our father David which is coming. Praise him in heaven!_

11 _And so Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. He looked at everything. Then he went out with the twelve disciples to Bethany. It was late already._

12 _In the morning when they were on the way out of Bethany, Jesus was hungry._

13 _He saw a fig tree a little way off with leaves on it. So he went to see if it had figs. He came to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. It was not the time for figs._

14 _Jesus said to the tree, No one will ever eat a fig from you again! His disciples heard what he said._

15 _They reached Jerusalem. Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves._

16 _He would not let anyone carry anything through the temple._

17 _He taught the people, saying, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house for all tribes and nations, where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!_

18 _The chief priests and scribes heard what he said. They wanted to find some way to kill him. They feared Jesus because all the people were surprised at his teaching._

19 _In the evening Jesus and his disciples went out of the city._

20 _The next morning they passed the fig tree again. They saw that it had died from the roots._

21 _Peter remembered about it. He said, Look Master, you cursed the fig tree and it has died._

22 _Jesus said, Believe in God._

23 _I tell you the truth. Anyone may say to this hill, "Go and jump into the sea." He must not doubt in his heart, but he must believe that he will have the things he asks for and he will have them._

24 _So I tell you, when you ask God for anything believe that you will get it and you will have it._

25 _When you stand and talk with God, forgive others for the wrong things they have done to you. Then your Father in heaven will also forgive you for the wrong things you have done._

26 _But if you do not forgive others, your Father in heaven will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done._

27 _They came to Jerusalem again. Jesus walked in the temple. The chief priests, the scribes,  and the leaders came to him._

28 _They said, What right have you to do these things? Who gave you the right to do them?_

29 _Jesus said, I will ask you a question. If you answer me, I will answer you and tell you what right I have to do these things._

30 _Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? Answer me!_

31 _So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"_

32 _But what if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it"? They feared the people because they all believed that John was a prophet of God._

33 _So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things._

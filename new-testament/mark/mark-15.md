1 _As soon as it was morning, the chief priests, leaders, and the scribes talked together.  They tied Jesus and took him before Pilate to be judged._

2 _Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus answered, Yes, I am._

3 _The chief priests brought many complaints against Jesus._

4 _Then Pilate asked him, Have you nothing to say? These people are bringing many complaints against you!_

5 _But Jesus said nothing. Pilate was very much surprised about this._

6 _At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free. He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free._

7 _In the prison was a man named Barabbas. He had led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man._

8 _The people started shouting. They asked Pilate to let one prisoner free, as he used to do._

9 _Then Pilate asked, Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?_

10 _He knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus. He knew that was why they brought Jesus to him._

11 _But the chief priests talked to the people. They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free._

12 _Pilate asked them, Then what shall I do with the man whom you call King of the Jews?_

13 _They shouted back, Nail him to a cross!_

14 _Pilate then asked, Why, what wrong thing has he done? But they shouted even more,  Nail him to a cross!_

15 _Pilate wanted to please the people, so he let Barabbas go free. He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross._

16 _The soldiers took Jesus to a room. They called all the soldiers together._

17 _They put a red gown on Jesus. They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head._

18 _Then they began to speak to him as if he were a king. They shouted, Greetings, King of the Jews!_

19 _They hit him on the head with a stick and spat on him. They kneeled down before him as if to give him great respect._

20 _When they had made fun of him, they took off the red gown and put his own clothes on him again. Then they took Jesus out of the city to nail him to a cross._

21 _man was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. Alexander and Rufus were his sons. The soldiers caught Simon and made him carry Jesus cross._

22 _They took Jesus to Golgotha. That means the place of a head bone._

23 _They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter. But Jesus would not drink it._

24 _Then they nailed him to a cross. They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus  clothes._

25 _It was nine oclock in the morning when they nailed him on the cross._

26 _They put the complaint they had against him above Jesus head. It was, The King of the Jews._

27 _They also nailed two bad men on crosses there. One was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of Jesus._

28 _The holy writings say, He was counted as one of the bad people. It came true._

29 _The people who passed by said wrong things about him. They shook their heads and said, Ha, ha! You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days._

30 _Save yourself and come down from the cross._

31 _The chief priests and the scribes also made fun of him. He saved other people, but he cannot save himself!_

32 _If he is the Christ, the king of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. We want to see it and believe! The bad men who were also nailed to crosses said the same things to him._

33 _About midday the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours._

34 _About three oclock, Jesus called out loud, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? That means,  My God, my God, why have you left me alone?_

35 _Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said, Listen, he is calling for Elijah!_

36 _One man ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink. He said, We will see if Elijah will come and take him down!_

37 _Then Jesus called out loud. Then he died._

38 _The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom._

39 _The captain who stood in front of Jesus saw that he died. He said, Surely, this man was Gods Son._

40 _Some women were watching from far away. Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of the younger James and Joses, and Salome._

41 _When Jesus was in Galilee, they came with him and helped him. Some other women who had come to Jerusalem with Jesus were also watching._

42 _It was now evening of the day before the Sabbath._

43 _Joseph of Arimathaea was a member of the court. He was a good man. He also was looking for the kingdom of God. He was not afraid, but went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus body._

44 _Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was dead already. He called the captain and asked him if Jesus was dead._

45 _The captain told him that he was. Then Pilate let Joseph take the body._

46 _Joseph went to buy some cloth. Then he took Jesus down and wrapped him in the cloth.  He laid him in a grave that had been cut in a rock. Then he rolled a very big stone to close the grave._

47 _Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where they laid Jesus._

[New Testament](/new-testament.html)

1 _From the leader of the church people. I send greetings to the lady whom God has chosen,  and to her children. I love you all because you have the truth about Christ. I am not the only one who loves you. All those who know the truth, love you also._

2 _We love you because of the truth we share which is in our hearts and will be with us for ever._

3 _God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Fathers son, will bless us. They will be kind to us.  They will give us peace. They will do these things because they are true, and they love us._

4 _I was very glad to find that some of your children are living in the right way. They are living the way the Father told us to live._

5 _And now I want to ask you to do something. I am not telling you to do something new. It is the same law we had from the beginning. It is this, We must love one another._

6 _We love God when we live the way God has told us. This is the law you heard from the beginning. You must live by it._

7 _Many men who fool people have gone out into the world. They believe that Jesus Christ did not come to live as a man with a body. These men belong to the one who fools people. He is against Christ._

8 _Watch out for yourselves! Do not lose what you have worked for, but receive all the reward that you should have._

9 _Everyone who goes too far, and does not believe what Christ taught, does not believe God. Anyone who believes what Christ taught, believes both the Father and the Son._

10 _If anyone comes to you who does not teach what Christ taught, do not take him into your house. Do not even greet him._

11 _Anyone who greets him helps him in the wrong things he does._

12 _I have much to write to you. But I do not want to write it on paper. I hope to come to visit you and talk with you. Then we will be very happy._

13 _The children of your sister whom God has chosen send their greetings._

[New Testament](/new-testament.html)

1 _I am Paul. I am in prison because I belong to Christ Jesus. Our brother Timothy and I send greetings to you, Philemon. We love you very much. And you work with us._

2 _We also send greetings to our sister Apphia; to Archippus who is worker in Gods army as we are; and to the people who meet as a church in your house._

3 _May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in their kindness and give you peace._

4 _I always thank my God when I talk to him about you._

5 _I have heard that you love all of Gods people and that you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ._

6 _You believe as I do. I ask God that he may help you to know more and more of every good thing that we have in Christ._

7 _My brother, your love made me very glad and it comforted my heart. I know that Gods people were glad because you loved them._

8 _Because I am Christs apostle, I could tell you what you must do._

9 _But because I love you, I would rather not tell you, but ask you to do this for me. I, Paul,  am an old man and now I am in prison because I belong to Jesus Christ._

10 _I am asking you to do something for my son. He became a Christian here in prison. This son is Onesimus._

11 _At one time he was no help to you. But now he is a big help to you and to me._

12 _I am sending him back to you and it is like sending you my own heart._

13 _I would like to keep him with me. He can help me while I am in prison for the sake of the good news. That would be just as if you were here to help me._

14 _But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed. I did not want you to do this because you were forced to do it, but because you wanted to do it._

15 _Maybe it was good for him to be away from you for a while. Now you will have him with you for ever._

16 _Now he is not like a slave who must work for you. He is better than a slave. He is a Christian brother and you will love him. I love him very much. But you will love him even more because he belongs to you and he is a Christian._

17 _So if you think of me as a real friend, take him back just as you would take me back._

18 _If he has done you any wrong, or if he owes you a debt, then ask me to pay it._

19 _I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it. I do not need to tell you that you have your life because of what I did for you._

20 _Yes, my brother, give me some help in the Lord. Make me happy in Christ._

21 _I believe that you will do what I ask you to do. And so I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask you to do._

22 _At the same time, please make a place ready for me to stay. I know you are asking God to set me free, so I believe he will let me come to see you._

23 _Epaphras is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus. He sends greetings to you._

24 _Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke are working with me. They all send greetings too._

25 _May the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen! May it be so!_

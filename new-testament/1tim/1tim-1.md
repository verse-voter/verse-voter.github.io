1 _I am Paul. I am an apostle of Christ Jesus. God and Christ Jesus told me to be an apostle.  God is our Saviour, and Christ is the one who gives us hope._

2 _Timothy, you are my true son because you believe the way I do. I ask God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord to show you love and kindness, and give you peace._

3 _When I went to the country of Macedonia, I asked you to stay in the city of Ephesus. I wanted you to tell some of the teachers not to teach wrong things._

4 _Tell them not to use stories that are not true, and long histories of names. These things often make people quarrel. These things do not make people believe and follow Gods way._

5 _Here is what teachers should aim at. Gods people should love each other with a love which comes from a clean heart, a clear mind, and true faith._

6 _Some teachers have not tried to do these things and so they talk about things that do no good._

7 _They want to teach the law. But they do not understand what they say. And they do not know what they are trying to prove._

8 _We know that the law is good when anyone uses it in the right way._

9 _He must understand that the law was not made for the man who lives right. It was made for those who do not want any laws over them, and for those who will not obey. It was made for those who do not respect God, and those who are bad people. It was made for those who do not respect anything that is holy or belongs to God. It was made for those who beat their fathers or mothers, and for those who kill people._

10 _It was made for those who use sex in the wrong way and for men who have sex with other men. It was made for those who steal people, for those who tell lies, for those who make a promise that is not true, and for any other thing that is not right._

11 _The wonderful good news of God teaches what is right. Praise him! And he has trusted me to tell this good news._

12 _I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me power to tell the good news. I thank him because he believed he could trust me, and he chose me for this work._

13 _There was a time when I did not respect him. I troubled his people. I said wrong things about him. But he was very kind to me, because I did not know what I was doing and I did not believe in him._

14 _Our Lord showed me much love and kindness. I believed in him and had the love which comes from Christ Jesus._

15 _These are true words and everyone should believe them. Christ Jesus came into the world to save bad people. And I am the worst of all._

16 _Jesus Christ wanted to show that he is very, very patient. And so he was kind to me who was the worst. He did this so that others would believe in him and live for ever._

17 _Give honour and praise for ever and ever to the one who is King for ever. He will never die. He cannot be seen. He is the only God. Yes, he is!_

18 _My son Timothy, here is what I tell you to do. And it is what the prophets said about you before. Remember their words, and fight like a good soldier._

19 _Keep on believing. Do only what you know is right. Some people have not done that and they have stopped believing._

20 _Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them. I have given them to Satan so that they will be punished and learn not to teach things that do not respect God._
